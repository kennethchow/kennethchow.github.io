Jumping straight into the deep end of things is a great way to learn. Learning to code is akin to learning a new language in the sense that once you understand a concept, you know it. And the best way to understand is to do, by doing we are firing and setting novel neural connections which in turn can be built upon. 

Elon Musk's principles for faster learning involve considering the context of what you're learning based on your experience and fundamental principles and comparing and contrasting this with the matter at hand. i.e. "What does this remind me of?" and "Why does this remind me of it?"

## Project Benson

For our first project we worked on analysing publicly available MTA entry and exit counts and our goal was to pitch a hypothetical business use of our analysis. Our brainchild involved using station exit data to identify hotspots of traffic at different times of day which could be used to dispatch cars accordingly for our hypothetical ride share company: NYber.

Pictured above is the product of over 3 hours of work and a sprinkle of vulgarity, but the process of running into obstacles and then problem solving is what stimulates growth.

Signing off with a quote from a great man.
