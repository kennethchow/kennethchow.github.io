<p>
  I'm a data scientist and aspiring bioinformatician. I grew up in Thailand, have lived in Tokyo, San Francisco and currently call London home.
</p>

<p>
  I recently completed an MSc in Bioninformatics at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/bioinformatics-msc/bay">Queen Mary University of London</a>. My thesis focused on advancing behavioural anlaysis of bumblebees to monitor health status, achieving an overall distinction - 80%.

When I'm not solving problems, I enjoy casual games of chess and take pride in being a health and fitness enthusiast.
