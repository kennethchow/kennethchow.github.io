title: A little bit about me
---

I'm Kenny and I'm from Malaysia but grew up in Thailand before completing my BSc in Genetics at the University of York. A bioinformatics elective that I worked on inspired the thought that data science had incredible applications in the field I was already in and now here I am working on a Data Science bootcamp called [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), an ACCET accredited bootcamp.
