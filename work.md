    <strong>[Employing deep learning to capture and characterise natural behaviours in Bumblebees]({% link _posts/2022-09-16-DL-for-bees.md%})</strong>
    &mdash;
    Built a deep learning pipeline to discern response to pesticides using video input data. Used a combination of object recognition networks for animal pose estimation and unsupervised learners to classify behaviours.

    <strong>[Crohn's disease diagnosis with MLP classifier](https://github.com/kennethchow/crohns-disease-mlp-tf2)</strong>
    &mdash;
    The dataset was comprised of metabolomic biomarkers in the form of GC-MS peaks across elution times from 4 sample types: blood, urine, faecal, and breath. Baseline classifiers were implemented to identify the optimal sample type. To further diagnostic accuracy, an MLP classifier was developed in Keras.
